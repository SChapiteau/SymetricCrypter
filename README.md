#SymetricCrypter

SymetricCrypter is an encryption library using [Vernam's argorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)
It is a simplified version of an algorithm that does not take into account certain restrictions.
The key is duplicated if necessary. 
This library creates visual and dissuasive encryption for a noephite of encryption. 
The security of the product code depends on the complexity of your key and the number of times it is used
